## Edinburgh Napier University | Azolla Group Project
### This project had an external client and was built according to the requirements specified by them. </br>
> The main goal of this group project module is to learn how project management/development works and gain experience in working in a team.
* The development team consisted of 2 sound design and 3 programming/art students.
* Time given: 1-2 months.
* Agile and Scrum approaches were implemented to make sure the project runs smoothly.
* Each team member had a different skill level therefore, multi-tasking was key to delivering a successful project.
* Due to short time frame given to develop this project, art design was kept to a minimum and the team more focused on programming side.

#### The early prototype of the game should showcase the idea of NFT usage and play-to-earn mechanics.
* The game shows an idea of NFT store implementation where a player can spend their earned tokens.
* Play-to-earn mechanics allow players to earn "tokens" through completing various in-game objectives.
