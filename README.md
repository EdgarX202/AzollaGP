# Azolla Group Project
Azolla’s aim is to bring sustainable travel to the mainstream, making sustainable efforts more accessible to travellers and service providers to have a positive environmental and cultural impact. Azolla’s ecosystem comprises of a sustainable travel booking app, online game and VR experience.

Azolla wishes to create a game that uses NFTs as a source of value to link back to the Azolla travel platform to be redeemed by users, and vice versa; travellers receive NFTs based on certain types of bookings that can unlock areas, characters or powers within the game.

NOTE: For this prototype, students are not expected to design or create NFTs, but only to consider this aspect in the overall concept for the game.

The game should touch on some of the Azolla 5 pillars below:

* Socio Economic
* Environment
* Culture and Heritage
* Resource Management
* Governance

Using some the above pillars for example; how can we inform and educate users about sustainability in a way that is fun and appealing?

The game should have an educational aspect to teach players about sustainability practices in a creative and fun way. This could be based on the completion of problem-solving tasks/challenges within the game.

The game can be in 2d or 3d, students have the creative freedom to develop a game with whatever gameplay mechanisms they desire.

## Proposed Game Plot

Azolla wishes to create a sustainability-themed game set on Planet Earth, in a state of ‘dystopia’ in the 2100s.

The planet suffered a number of disasters caused by climate change and massive destruction caused by World Wars. Due to a global shortage of food and water supplies, many citizens died, however the remaining survivors managed to escape on space ships. The survivors spent time in space trying to find a new home, meeting new civilisations and planning their dream to return to Earth once again. The objective of the game is to restore the planet back to a place where human civilisation can return to live and prosper.

Deliverables

* Playable prototype with at least 1-2 levels to showcase the totality of the concept
* Project documents as specified by the module
* Press kit
* Walkthrough video or edited trailer
* At this stage, students are not expected to develop any NFTs or any integrations of them
* Students have the freedom to use any game engine they see appropriate for the project
